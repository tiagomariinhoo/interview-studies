What is GraphQL -> https://www.redhat.com/pt-br/topics/api/what-is-graphql

Basically GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook. One of the problemas that we have today
is that the client needs to consume all the informations that are given by the server side and
usually it's necessary make a lot of different endpoints to get those informations.

Using the GraphQL the client decies which informations he want to consume. This can avoid the
over-fetching (that would be consume datas that u don't even need)
