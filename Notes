Recently I have received a lot of queries regarding my preparation that landed me to FAANG company. Below are some of the resources that helped me a lot -

Coding Interview
1. Solve Leetcode medium level problems (at least more than 250+ covering different topics)
2. I have created an xlsx on top/important 500 leetcode questions (https://lnkd.in/dWn73jXd) and a video on How to Crack The Coding Interview? (https://lnkd.in/dsn4cipq). 
3. Clement Mihailescu's AlgoExpert 169 handpicked questions (In case you want to prepare fast and only good questions)
4. I watched my DSA playlist to revise concepts at 2x speed. (https://lnkd.in/dJfS9FkD)

System Design / High Level Design Interview
1. Grokking the System Design Interview - It has step by step discussion and good case studies (https://lnkd.in/dbv8GhK7)
2. Alex Xu's System Design Interview course on ByteByteGo (https://bytebytego.com/) - The course covers all the content from his famous book (Vol 1 and Vol 2) System Design Interview
3. Clement Mihailescu #SystemsExpert (https://lnkd.in/d-5mSpfw) videos to know how real life System Design Interviews go 

Object Oriented Design / Low Level Design Interview
1. Grokking the Object Oriented Design Interview (https://lnkd.in/dcwE3v6V) - A very detailed and step by step approach to various object oriented design case studies. 

API Design Interview
1. Best Practices (https://lnkd.in/d_x39xkK), Implementation (https://lnkd.in/d5fhXZJ7) and Guidelines (https://lnkd.in/dr397Hy2) of API Design
2. Look for use cases like - Stripe (https://lnkd.in/dsM7PpJt) and Twitter (https://lnkd.in/dxiMu8wr) API Documentation
3. #SystemsExpert also has few case studies on API design as well

Schema / Database Design Interview
1. Grokking the Object Oriented Design Interview (https://lnkd.in/dcwE3v6V) - Take the case studies and try to apply Object to Relational Mapping strategy

Behavioral Interview
1. Watch Jeff H Sipe, Interview / Negotiation Coach Youtube channel for behavioral questions (https://lnkd.in/d6rgxbnr)
2. https://lnkd.in/dXBfNNK9

Important DSA topics?
Array, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Matrix, Two Pointer, Intervals, Hash Map, String, Recursion, DP, Trees, Graph, Linked List, Stack, Queue & Heap

------------------- 2023 Google Interview
- https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/3171859/Journey-to-a-FAANG-Company-Amazon-or-SDE2-(L5)-or-Bangalore-or-Oct-2022-Accepted
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wKcV99KtO91dXdPkwmXGTdtyxAfk1mbPXQg81R9sFE/edit#gid=0

During DSA round
- Discuss the problem before deep diving into it
- Start with a brute force solution without thinking much on optimisation
- Be vocal while writing code and verifying your code 
- Run your code and effor spent on thinking about corner cases
- If asked with behavioural questions, then keep it shor and direct

For DSA preparation
- Complete all the topic wise sections in the study plan section of the leet code.
- Practice questions in a time constrained manner, no point of spending hours in a single question.

Behavioural round
- List out 5-10 important challenging situations, achievements, failures that you have gone through over the last 1-2 years
- What was the situation and tasks
- What actions you have taken and what the results and learning from that
